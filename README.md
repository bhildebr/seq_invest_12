## General Introduction

The Sequential Investment Game is a "multiplayer extension" of a classical Decision Theory problem. While the Kelly Criterion yields an optimum investment strategy for just one person involved, the main purpose of this project is to analyze whether there is an optimum strategy for playing the Sequential Investment Game with several players.

The Kelly Criterion has a representation in all kinds of real life investment strategies. The extension made in the Sequential Investment Game can be interpreted as some kind of competitive stimulus.


## The Model

Independent variables:

- chance of winning a single stage [p]
- number of stages per round [K]

Dependent variables:

- own total at the end of a round
- the other players total at the end of a round
- type of strategy chosen by a player


## Fundamental Questions

- Is there an optimum strategy for playing the Sequential Investment Game with 2 (or 3) players?
  (In other words: Is there a Nash Equilibrium?)
- If so, does this strategy correlate with the Kelly Criterion? How?


## Expected Results

Since ties are broken randomly and playing with the same strategy has the same expected value for each players winnings, all players using the same investment strategy could always result in a tie in the long run.
